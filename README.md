## Flappy Bird: A Classic Game in Java

This project implements the classic Flappy Bird game using Java's Swing libraries and the AWT package. Players control a bird, navigating it through obstacles (pipes) while avoiding collisions. The game features:

* **Visuals:** Background, bird, and pipe images provide a clear and engaging user experience.
* **Gameplay loop:** A game loop timer updates the bird's position, moves pipes across the screen, and checks for collisions with pipes or the screen boundaries.
* **Scoring:** Players earn points for passing between pipes.
* **Game Over:** Collision or exceeding the screen boundaries triggers a "Game Over" state.
* **Restart:** Players can restart the game by pressing the spacebar after a game over.

This project demonstrates fundamental game development skills in Java, including:

* Utilizing Swing for graphics and user interaction.
* Implementing a game loop for real-time updates.
* Handling collisions and game over states.
* Managing game objects and their properties.
* Integrating user input for player control.
